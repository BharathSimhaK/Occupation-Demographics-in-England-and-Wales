# Occupation Demographics in England and Wales

The goal of this project is to focus on the demographics of occupation in England and Wales. The project explores the relationship between various socio-economic aspects and occupations in a workplace population.


## Dataset

The data used in this project is taken from the 2011 census in England and Wales, which is indexed by the Excel file 2011CensusIndexofTablesandTopics_v11_4_2.xlsx. 
## Tech Stack

**Programming Languages:** Python

**Tools:** Tableau,Excel

**Methods Used:** Data pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Data Projection.


## Models

The Data Peojection Algorithms used are:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

## Documentation

Here is the link to the documentation


## Repository Structure

 - `src_code`: contains the code for the data  projections.
 - `documentation` : contains the indepth explanation of the processes and code.
 - `dashboards`: contains the occupation demographic dashboards
## Usage

To reproduce the predictions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the `.ipynb` file to produce data projections on the vast data. 
4. Run the `.twbx` file to visualise the dashboards 
   

## Conclusion

Successfully carried out a complete visual analytics project consisting of various phases from data preparation to data projections. By considering Munznerâ€™s task taxonomy, created interactive dashboards that helped users view, understand, and visualize the demographics of occupations in a workplace region of England and Wales.

Overall, found that professional occupations were the highest in England and Wales, with the majority of people belonging to public administration, health, and education industries. Also found that the majority of people in this occupation were aged between 30 to 34 years, with most of them having level 4 and above qualifications. Furthermore, more than 25% of people in this occupation travelled less than 5 kilometres to their workplace, with most of them commuting using a car or a van.

These insights are only an overview of the demographics of occupation in England and Wales. The interactive dashboards allow users to explore more insights region-wise. In addition, two data projection algorithms are used to reduce the complexity of the data by implementing dimensionality reduction and explained the clusters formed in Tableau.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the demographics of occupations in a workplace region of England and Wales. The interactive dashboards and data projections can help policymakers and researchers make informed decisions about workforce planning and development.
